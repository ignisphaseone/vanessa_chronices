About

Vanessa Chronicles is a 2D puzzle-adventure game, where you control a person
who dreams the death of people around her. Do you find them and save them? Do
you simply let them die?

Installing/Developing

I'm using Python, PyOpenGL, and an assortment of python libraries to run this
code. Unfortunately, I forgot the full list! As this project develops more,
this will likely become more fleshed out. For now, it's just my Game Over
placeholder for PyOpenGL.
